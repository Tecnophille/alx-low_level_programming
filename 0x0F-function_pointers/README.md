# 0x0F-function_pointers
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering** at **ALX**. To learn about function pointers in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc`
* C files are written according to the Betty coding standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-print_name.c` | Prints a name |
| `1-array_iterator.c` | Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array |
| `2-int_index.c` | Searches for an integer |
| `3-calc.h` | Header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures |
| `3-op_functions.c` | File that contains functions that calculates arithmetic operations |
| `3-get_op_func.c` | Function pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions |
| `3-main.c` | Entry point |
| `100-main_opcodes.c` | Prints the opcodes of its own main function |
